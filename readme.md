## Project Details
This page is an exercise in using ajax requests to fetch data from a 3rd party API, in this case, the New York Times.  The page content is generated dynamically as a result of data served up by the API.  Additional css and jQuery animations, transitions and effects are used to give the site a more enhanced feel.

### Knowledge Gained
JQuery, Ajax, 3rd party API's, looping through complicated JSON objects in order to retrieve and display only what is of interest.  The development environment was set up using a local node.js server running GULP with several additional packages downloaded with the node package manager.  File changes were linted with eslint, js and css files were minified with Uglify, changes were pushed to the local browser with browser-sync, build files were prefixed for cross-browser support with auto-prefixer.  Css for this project was built with Sass.
